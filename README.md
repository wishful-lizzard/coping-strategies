# Autism Coping Strategies
A exhaustive but concise list of coping strategies for autistic people.

The idea of this list is for autistic people to get inspiration on how to make their lives easier. It's kind of a best-of of reddit and other forums as well as self-help books. The idea is to very briefly describe a problem and a strategy, then link to pages, articles or forum threads with more information.

Autistic People are not all alike. You are unique - that's why not all of these strategies will apply to you. This is for inspiration - feel free to adapt every strategy until it suits you.

This list is maintained by [wishful-lizzard](https://github.com/wishful-lizzard), but open for anyone to [contribute](https://github.com/wishful-lizzard/coping-strategies/blob/main/README.md#how-to-contribute).

You can discuss the contents of this list in a thread on reddit [TODO: Add Link]().

Coping is the act of dealing with problems or stressors. A coping strategy either deals with the external problem by removing or avoiding it, or it deals with your internal emotional reaction to that problem. Coping strategies are sometimes called coping mechanisms. The former implies deliberately employed actions, the latter may be unconcious.

## Example for a Coping Strategy
For many autistic people, noisy environments are a problem that causes stress.
One coping strategy would be to just avoid noisy environments altogether - but that is not always possible.
Strategies that try to reduce the external problem include noise reduction headphones or earplugs. Strategies dealing with external problems are usually specific to the problem.
Strategies that deal with internal emotional reactions are usually less specific to the problem. An example would be trying to reduce the 

Coping is a process rather than an event. You may alternate between several of the above coping strategies in order to cope with a stressful event.
