# Autism Coping Strategies
A concise but exhaustive list of coping strategies for autistic people.

The idea of this list is for autistic people to get inspiration on how to make their lives easier.
Autistic People are not all alike. That's why not all of these strategies will apply to you. I'm happy if you find something that helps you.

This list is maintained by [wishful-lizzard](https://github.com/wishful-lizzard), but open for anyone to [contribute]().
