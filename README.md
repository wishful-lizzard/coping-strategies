# Autism Coping Strategies
A exhaustive but concise list of coping strategies for autistic people.

The idea of this list is for autistic people to get inspiration on how to make their lives easier. It's kind of a best-of of reddit and other forums as well as self-help books. The idea is to very briefly describe a problem and a strategy, then link to pages, articles or forum threads with more information.

Autistic People are not all alike. You are unique - that's why not all of these strategies will apply to you. This is for inspiration - feel free to adapt every strategy until it suits you.

This list is maintained by [wishful-lizzard](https://github.com/wishful-lizzard), but open for anyone to [contribute](https://github.com/wishful-lizzard/coping-strategies/blob/main/README.md#how-to-contribute). You can discuss the contents of this list with me and others in a thread on reddit [TODO: Add Link]().

# General Notes on Coping Strategies
Coping is the act of dealing with problems or stressors. A coping strategy either deals with the external problem by removing or avoiding it, or it deals with your internal emotional reaction to that problem. Coping strategies are sometimes called coping mechanisms. The former implies deliberately employed actions, the latter may be a more unconcious reaction of your body and mind.

## Example for a Coping Strategy
For many autistic people, noisy environments are a problem that causes stress.

One coping strategy would be to just **avoid all noisy situations altogether**. But that is not always possible, which is why we have to cope with that problem in other ways.

Strategies that try to **reduce the impact of the external problem** include noise reduction headphones or earplugs. Strategies dealing with external problems are usually specific to the problem.

Strategies that deal with internal emotional reactions are usually less specific to the problem. An example would be trying to reduce the stress you experience by using a breathing technique.

## Coping is not a One-Time Thing
Coping is a process rather than an event. You may alternate between several coping strategies depending on the situation, your daily form or your preference. A coping strategy might help one day, but not on another. You might know a coping strategy, but not be able to put it into action. Especially dealing with our emotional reactions takes time and practice. 

Be kind to yourself.
