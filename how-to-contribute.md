# How to contribute
* Have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup)
* If you know how to use GitHub: create a pull request with your suggestions. Thank you!
* If you don't know what any of this means: read on :)
* Go to the lists home: [https://github.com/wishful-lizzard/coping-strategies](https://github.com/wishful-lizzard/coping-strategies)
* Edit the file README.md to include your suggestions - don't worry, you can't break anything. You can use [this link for getting to the edit page](https://github.com/wishful-lizzard/coping-strategies/edit/main/README.md).
* Scroll all the way down. There should be a box titled "commit changes". This allows you to describe your changes with a short title and/or long text.
* Click the button that creates a pull request - this notifies the author (wishful-lizzard).
* They will review your change, and add it to the list.
