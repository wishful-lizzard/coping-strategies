# How to contribute
* Have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup)
* Edit the file README.md to include your suggestions - don't worry, you can't break anything. You can use [this link for getting to the edit page](https://github.com/wishful-lizzard/coping-strategies/edit/main/README.md).
* Scroll all the way down. There should be a box titled "commit changes". This allows you to describe your changes with a short title and/or long text.
* Click the button that creates a pull request - this notifies the author (wishful-lizzard)
* Edit this list to include your strategy
* Start a pull request
(TODO: Short explanation for Pull Requests, link to a GitHub Intro)
